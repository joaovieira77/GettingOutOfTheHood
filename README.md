This is a project I worked on with a friend as part of a group collaboration, where we used GitHub for version control. 
The project is a front-end Spotify data analysis app built using React. We sourced user data from a custom database and focused on creating clear visualizations and personalized music statistics to ensure a smooth and engaging user experience.
